# OpenAL Plugin for Godot

This plugin provides custom nodes for using OpenAL Soft directly in Godot, bypassing Godot's built-in audio system.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Plugin

Clone `godot-openal` to the `your_game/addons/` folder:

```bash
cd your_game
mkdir addons
cd addons
git clone git@github.com:vercidium-audio/godot-openal.git`
```

### 2. Enable the Plugin

1. Open your Godot project
2. Ensure your C# solution is created: `Project > Tools > C# > Create C# Solution`
3. Enable `godot_openal` in `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`

If you get the below error, make sure you've created a C# solution first (step 2 above):

```
[godot-openal] No C# solution found. Please create a C# solution first (Project → Tools → C# → Create C# Solution)
```

After creating a C# project, disable and enable the `godot-openal` plugin in `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` to perform setup.

#### 3. Automatic Dependency Setup

The plugin setup script in `addons/godot-openal/plugin.gd` will perform some setup logic for you.

First, it will add this text to your project's `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Allow unsafe code (required for buffering audio data to OpenAL Soft) -->
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
    <!-- C# bindings for OpenAL Soft -->
    <PackageReference Include="openal_soft_bindings" Version="1.0.3" />

    <!-- C# bindings for OpenAL Soft -->
    <PackageReference Include="NAudio" Version="2.2.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="BunLabs.NAudio.Flac" Version="2.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="NVorbis" Version="0.10.5" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Second, it will copy `soft_oal.dll` or `libopenal.so.1` (depending on your operating system) to your project root, which is where your project searches for `.dll` files when it runs.

### 4. Customise the ALManager

The `addons/godot0openal/autoload/ALManagerAutoload.tscn` scene contains the global `ALManager` node.

> If you don't see this file, you may not have enabled the plugin correctly. See 'Step 2. Enable the Plugin' above.

This `ALManager` node overrides Godot's inbuilt audio system, and has settings for controlling volume, enabling HRTF, output/input device, etc.

To verify your installation worked, the Output Device Name field should be populated in the inspector.

### 5. Play a Sound

Create an `ALSource3D` node and set its `Sound Name` to the path of the sound in the `res://audio` folder. To play the sound, invoke `.Play()` on the node via GDScript or C#.

If your sound files live in a different folder, you can set a custom path using the `audio/openal_sound_folder.custom` setting:
